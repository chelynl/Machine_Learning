# Machine Learning Predictive Modeling

### Overview
We are provided data with 3 targets and 127 attributes (v1-v127). Multiple machine learning models will be explored to best predict one of the target variables. We will only be focusing on Binary Target 2 for this project.

### Targets
- cont.target (continuous target variable)
- binary.target1 (binary target)
- binary.target2 (binary target)

For the 2 binary targets, false positives are more costly than false negatives - certainty regarding predicted events is paramount and thus the accuracy of the model might best be scored using positive predictive value or lift at depth of 10-20%. Area under the ROC curve and Averaged Squared Error are also sound and common error metrics used in this application.
